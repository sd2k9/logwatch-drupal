Logwatch filters for Drupal Syslog messages

Motivation: I want to use logwatch with my Debian installation
of Drupal, and it seems there are no drupal filters existing yet.
So in case there are (and I just did not found them) - let me know
so I don't waste my time :-)

Otherwise - feel free to contribute.
